# 🚀 Contexer – The Autonomous AI Developer

> **Describe your app. Watch it build itself.**

Contexer is not just another AI code generator.  
It’s the world’s first **autonomous AI development agent** that **builds, observes, and fixes** web applications — with minimal human intervention.

Unlike traditional AI builders that require endless prompting, **Contexer learns your vision once** and then **iteratively improves** your app until it works exactly as intended.

## 🌟 What Is Contexer?

Contexer is an **autonomous AI development platform** where you define the **context** of your project — not through vague prompts, but through structured input — and an AI agent (**Viber**) takes over to:

1. **Build** your app using AI
2. **Observe** the preview and terminal in real time
3. **Detect** when features don’t work or errors occur
4. **Fix** issues automatically (with your approval)
5. **Repeat** until your app is production-ready

> 🔥 It’s like having a **junior developer who never sleeps**, learns from your vision, and asks for approval before making changes.

## 🧠 How It Works

Contexer replaces the **prompt → generate → fix → repeat** loop with a **closed-loop autonomous system**:

```
  ┌─────────────────┐
  │  Context Composer │ ← You define the vision
  └────────┬────────┘
           │ (Project Context)
           ▼
  ┌──────────────┐
  │     Viber       │ ← Autonomous AI Agent
  │ (Builds & Fixes) │ ← Orchestrates everything
  └──────┬─────────┘
         │ (Generates prompts)
         ▼
  ┌──────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────────┐
  │   AI Builder      │ ←→ │   Visual Observer     │
  │ (File Generator)  │    │ (Eyes on Preview)     │
  └────────┬─────────┘    └────────────┬─────────┘
           │                           │ (Is it working?)
           │                           ▼
           └───────────────→ [Feature Not Working?]
                                     │
                     No ┌───────────┴────────────┐ Yes
                        ▼                        ▼
                [Generate Fix Prompt]    [Move to Next Feature]
                        │
                        ▼
                 ┌──────────────┐
                 │  Error Fixer  │ ← Auto-fixes errors
                 │ (With Approval)│ ← You’re always in control
                 └──────────────┘
```

### ✅ The User Flow

1. **Define Your Vision**  
   → Use **Context Composer** to describe your app’s goal, user stories, tech stack, and even upload a `README.md`

2. **Start the Agent**  
   → Click **"Start Viber"** — the AI agent reads your context and begins building

3. **Watch It Build Itself**  
   → Viber generates code, starts the dev server, and watches the preview and terminal

4. **It Fixes Its Own Errors**  
   → If a linter, terminal, or console error occurs, **Error Fixer** suggests a fix — you approve it with one click

5. **It Validates Features**  
   → **Visual Observer** checks if features work as intended — if not, Viber generates a new prompt to improve them

6. **You Stay in Control**  
   → Every major change requires **your approval** — no surprise breakages

## 🔁 Why Contexer Is Different

| Feature | Contexer | Bolt / Lovable / v0 |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| **Prompting** | One-time context setup → AI remembers | Constant prompting needed |
| **Autonomy** | Self-correcting loop: build → observe → fix | Manual: you detect and fix errors |
| **Error Handling** | Auto-detects and suggests fixes | You copy-paste errors into chat |
| **Context Awareness** | Remembers your project goals across sessions | Forgets context between prompts |
| **User Stories** | Tracks feature completion against user stories | No feature validation |
| **Progress Tracking** | Shows % complete based on build status | No progress feedback |
| **Approval System** | Never auto-applies — you’re always in control | Risk of unintended changes |

> 💡 **Contexer doesn’t just generate code — it ships working apps.**

## 🧩 Core Features

### 🧠 Context Composer
The **single source of truth** for your project.  
You describe:
- App goal
- User stories ("As a user, I want to...")
- Tech stack (Next.js, React, etc.)
- Upload a `README.md`

Viber uses this context **for every decision** — no more guessing what you meant.

### 🤖 Viber – The Autonomous Agent
The **CEO of your development process**.  
Viber:
- Reads your context
- Generates AI prompts
- Watches the build
- Decides when to fix, improve, or move on
- Always asks for approval

It’s not magic — it’s **context-driven autonomy**.

### 👁️ Visual Observer
The **eyes** of the system.  
It:
- Streams terminal logs in real time
- Highlights errors (no more scrolling)
- Tracks build progress (0% → 100%)
- Validates if features work as intended

No vision AI needed — just smart log parsing and DOM checks.

### 🛠️ Error Fixer
The **hands** that fix problems.  
When an error occurs:
- Auto-detects the issue
- Uses AI to suggest a fix
- Shows a **diff preview**
- Waits for **your approval**
- Applies the change

No more copy-pasting errors into ChatGPT.

## 🎯 Who Is Contexer For?

### ✅ Perfect For:
- **Indie Hackers** who want to ship apps fast
- **Developers** tired of re-prompting loop,hallucinations
- **Product Managers** who can describe features but not code
- **Bootstrapped Founders** building MVPs alone
- **AI Enthusiasts** exploring autonomous systems

## 🚀 The Future of Development

Contexer is the first step toward **AI developers that can build, test, and fix apps with minimal input** — while keeping **you in control**.

We believe the future of development is:
- **Context-driven**, not prompt-driven
- **Autonomous**, but never out of control
- **Observant**, not blind
- **Self-correcting**, not error-prone

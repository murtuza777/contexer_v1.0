# 🚀 Contexer – Autonomous AI Development Platform

**Contexer** is a next-generation autonomous development platform that can **understand your project idea, generate production-ready code, and iteratively refine it until it matches your exact requirements** — all while fixing errors automatically.

Think of it as your **24/7 AI development team** that:
- Reads your project context like a senior architect
- Writes high-quality code
- Tests and verifies every feature
- Fixes errors instantly
- Keeps improving until the feature is perfect

## 🌟 What Makes Contexer Different?

Unlike regular AI coding tools that only respond to prompts, **Contexer builds an app end-to-end** by combining four powerful components:

1. **📝 Context Composer** – Your project blueprint  
   - Answer simple guided questions about your app:  
     _Description, Tech Stack, Features, Detailed Functionality, README, etc._  
   - Your answers are stored as **structured context** for the AI.  
   - You can **update, add, or change features anytime**.

2. **🤖 Viber Agent** – The intelligent project manager  
   - Reads your context from the Composer.  
   - Generates **precise, high-quality prompts** for the AI Builder.  
   - Decides the build order of features.  
   - Coordinates with the Visual Observer for continuous improvement.  
   - Sends all generated prompts into the AI Builder's chat (so you can still add manual prompts).

3. **👀 Visual Observer** – The feature quality inspector  
   - Actively monitors the build process.  
   - Checks which features are working and compares them to your context requirements.  
   - Detects missing or incorrect features.  
   - Tells Viber to re-prompt the AI Builder with **"Build this correctly"** instructions.  
   - Ensures features are refined until **production-ready**.

4. **🛠 Error Fixer** – The automatic debugger  
   - Monitors for linter, terminal, console, or runtime errors.  
   - Fixes them instantly without you having to write any prompts.  
   - Works quietly in the background so you can focus on the build.

## ⚡ How the Build Process Works

1. **Provide Your Context**  
   Use the **Context Composer** to describe your app, tech stack, and features in detail.

2. **Start the Agent**  
   Click the **Start** button (like v0.dev’s interface) to launch the Viber Agent.

3. **Viber Takes Over**  
   - Reads your context.
   - Generates a **perfect AI prompt** to begin development.
   - Sends it to the **AI Builder** (in the chat, so you can see and add your own prompts anytime).

4. **AI Builder Creates Your Project**  
   - Generates the codebase and features.  
   - Viber + Visual Observer loop begins.

5. **Continuous Improvement Loop**  
   - Visual Observer checks each feature → compares to context → reports to Viber.  
   - Viber sends new prompts → AI Builder refines code.  
   - Loop continues until feature matches your exact requirement.

6. **Error Handling**  
   - Any errors? The Error Fixer steps in automatically.  
   - You never have to manually debug.
